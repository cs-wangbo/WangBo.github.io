Dr. Bo Wang is a PHD from College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University. 

# RESEARCH FOCUS

Advanced deep learning technologies have enabled the characterization of tissue complexity and provided biological insights into spatial organization within tissues. My research is focused on developing deep learning models to analyze spatial transcriptomics data. 
Specifically, my research interests include:

**1. Deep Learning**

Graph Learning for biological application
  
Self-supervised learning
  
Contrastive Learning
  
**2. Single-cell Omics and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis**
   
Spatial clustering
  
Cell type deconvolution
  
Spatial multi-omics integration
